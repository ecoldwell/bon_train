				<h1>ABT</h1>
				<p>Atelier Bon Train is an inclusive woodworking studio that seeks to provide affordable access to woodworking tools and machinery for artisans and artists, and offer specialized services to visual artists. Established in the fall of 2020 by Rafaël Khoury, Kevin Husereault and Elizabeth Xu, Bon Train originated from a modest basement studio in the Plateau-Mont Royal. Khoury, Huserault and Xu set out to foster a unique, diverse and inclusive space for artists and woodworkers to share skills and knowledge. We welcome anyone to join us in our mission to serve the community better. </p>
